# Digital-Clock-
This is a Digital Clock that utilizes a Zybo-Z7-10 and an external 4-digit 7-segment display. The current implementation has the first two digits holding the minutes
and the last two digits holding the seconds. This can be changed to represent a regular digital clock using hours and minutes.
